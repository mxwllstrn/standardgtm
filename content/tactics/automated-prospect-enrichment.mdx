## Problem Solved: Manual Data Gathering & Stale CRMs

Sales teams manually spend hours scouring multiple sources for prospect and account data. This leads to:
* Inaccurate or incomplete CRM records.
* Outdated information on funding rounds, news, or tech stacks.
* Inefficient personalization, as reps lack deep context.

## The Workflow: Real-time Data, Automated

This tactic leverages powerful data enrichment platforms to automatically pull comprehensive data points for your prospects and accounts, pushing them directly into your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) as soon as a new lead enters or an account is identified.

### **Steps:**

1.  **Define Data Points:** Identify key information critical for your GTM teams (e.g., employee count, industry, revenue, funding rounds, technographics, recent news mentions, key executive contacts, LinkedIn profiles).
2.  **Choose Your Orchestrator:** Select an automation platform like Make (formerly Integromat) or Zapier.
3.  **Integrate CRM Trigger:** Set up a trigger in your orchestrator: "When a new contact/company is created or updated in HubSpot (or Salesforce)."
4.  **Connect to Enrichment Tool (Clay):**
    * **Clay Workflow:** Design a workflow in Clay.com that takes the basic lead/account data (like company name or domain) as input.
    * **Data Sources:** Within Clay, configure various data sources (e.g., Clearbit, Apollo, Crunchbase, BuiltWith, custom web scraping steps for news) to pull your desired data points. Clay's "Find Companies" or "Find People" tables are incredibly powerful for this.
5.  **Transform & Map Data:** Ensure Clay outputs the data in a clean, structured format that perfectly maps to your CRM fields.
6.  **Push to CRM:** Use your orchestrator (Make/Zapier) to push the enriched data back into the corresponding CRM fields for the contact/company.
7.  **Real-time Alerts (Optional):** Trigger Slack notifications or email alerts to relevant sales reps when a high-value account is newly enriched with critical information.
