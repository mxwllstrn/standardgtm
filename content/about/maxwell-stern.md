## My Journey to GTM Engineering

I'm Maxwell Stern, and my career has been a journey from the raw, iterative energy of bootstrapping a software company to the structured, strategic world of advising founders. This unique blend of hands-on building and high-level guidance has forged my deep conviction: Go-to-Market is no longer just an art â€“ it's an engineering discipline.

### **Founder & Operator (Closure Software, 2017-2022)**

For five years, I lived and breathed the challenges of scaling a B2B SaaS business from zero. I wrote the first line of code, made the first sale, and built Closure Software into an 8-figure exit with ~$8MM ARR, scaling to over 1,000 enterprise customers and 25 full-time employees. This experience taught me:

* **The Power of Efficient GTM:** How to build lean, sales-driven businesses and optimize customer acquisition pipelines.
* **Financial Impact:** A deep understanding of how GTM decisions directly impact core metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), and Net Revenue Retention (NRR), as evidenced by our minimal 2-3% churn rate.
* **Building from Scratch:** The practical realities of establishing a GTM tech stack from the ground up.

### **Educator & Advisor (Duke University, Melissa & Doug Entrepreneur, 2023-Present)**

As a Lecturing Fellow, I now guide and advise over 80 student founders per semester at Duke University. My role extends beyond theory, providing hands-on advisory in GTM strategies, product development, and operational execution.

* **Quantifiable Impact:** I directly catalyzed ApplicationAlly's growth from $8k to $250k ARR and identified/halved BetaCare's high churn rate (800k MAUs), demonstrating my ability to drive tangible improvements through data analysis and strategic problem-solving.
* **Empathetic Advising:** My focus is on coaching and empowering founders to build robust, scalable operations themselves, aligning perfectly with Primary.vc's Impact Team ethos.

### **Venture Studio Founder (Stern Innovations, 2018-2022)**

Launching 8 software businesses and deploying $300k capital allowed me to deeply understand the venture ecosystem. I successfully fundraised for portfolio companies from top accelerators like Y Combinator and Techstars, further cementing my grasp of what investors seek in scalable GTM.

## My GTM Engineering Philosophy

My career has been about identifying bottlenecks and proactively building solutions. At StandardGTM, this translates into a core philosophy: **GTM success isn't about 'magic' or 'growth hacking' alone. It's about building predictable, automated, and data-driven systems.** It's about clean data in, clear results out.

I combine strategic architectural thinking with hands-on technical execution, ensuring that GTM isn't just about flashy campaigns, but about robust, financially sound operational execution that scales.

## Broader Tool Fluency

Beyond the specific tools demonstrated in my Labs, I possess deep administrative and strategic fluency across a wide range of GTM & Automation tools, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Clay, Zapier, Make, n8n, Outreach, Gong, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Mixpanel, and Pendo. My technical background in Python, JavaScript, and SQL further enables custom automations and AI integrations.

I'm here to transform your Go-to-Market into a predictable, engineered engine for growth.
